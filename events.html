      <h1>Chicago: The Black Experience</h1>
          <p>Chicago is a melting pot for multiple cultures, but the culture of Black people 
            in Chicago is one that is important and extremely personal. There are so many 
            organizations, restaurants, and events ran by Black people that have a 
            positive impact on the community.

        <br><h2>Bud Billiken Parade</h2>
        <p>The Bud Billiken® Parade is the largest African American parade in the United States. 
            It takes place right on the South Side of Chicago going down King Drive. The parade 
            has taken place every year since 1929 and it has united African-Americans throughout 
            the city of Chicago in music, dance, food, and laughter since the start. This parade 
            allows youth to show the talents they have been practicing over the summer leading up 
            to the parade and it helps youth celebrate their return to school. Each year the parade 
            has over 100 organizations participate in the parade. Students also receive school 
            supplies to help them with resources for the start of school. The Bud Billiken is near 
            and dear to my heart because as a kid, I went to the parade every year with my aunt and 
            cousins. The Bud Billiken is notorious for bringing the Black community together.

            <h4>The Taste of Chicago</h4>
            <p>The Taste of Chicago is the world’s largest free-admission outdoor food festival. The 
                festival was started over 40 years ago and it has continuously grown over the years. 
                This festival gives citizens and tourists the opportunity to get a taste of Chicago 
                specialties all in one place. Multiple vendors participate in this festival through pop-up 
                shops and food trucks. Food is not the only thing you get at the Taste of Chicago! There is 
                also entertainment such as dance performances, art showcases, and live singing performances. 
                The only catch is that attendees do have to purchase tickets in order to participate and 
                indulge in the delicious food. The experience is well worth it!
