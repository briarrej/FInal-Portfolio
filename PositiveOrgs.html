      <h1>Chicago: The Black Experience</h1>
          <p>Chicago is a melting pot for multiple cultures, but the culture of Black people 
            in Chicago is one that is important and extremely personal. There are so many 
            organizations, restaurants, and events ran by Black people that have a 
            positive impact on the community.

     <h2>My Block, My Hood, My City </h2>
  
      <p>My Block, My Hood, My City’s  (M3) purpose is “to inspire youth, empower communities, 
        and build a better world one block at a time.” This organization motivates everyone to 
        take action and do something to better their community. M3 emphasizes the importance of 
        exploring new communities and cultures to truly gain a better understanding of the world. 
        Within M3, there is a program, Explorers Program, that gives youth from deprived communities 
        opportunities to explore Vocation/Education, Arts Expression, Culinary Experiences, and 
        Recreation sites within the city of Chicago and beyond. This exposure helps open the youth’s 
        minds to things outside of their community. </p>

      <h3>EmpowerYouth!</h3>
      <p>EmpowerYouth! is a program through the Chicago Urban League where 30 African American 
        high school students work to put on a performance. This program is in partnership with 
        the Lyrica Opera of Chicago and it allows students exposure to different art forms such 
        as opera, acting, singing, dancing, and more. Students are able to express themselves 
        through the arts and learn new art forms, which are showcased in the final performance. 
        EmpowerYouth! gives Black students a space to be creative and have an amazing support 
        system filled with resources.</p>

      <h4>Social Works</h4>
      <p>Social Works is a non-profit organization formed by Chance the Rapper, an African 
        American artist who is Chicago Native. Since 2016, Social Works has aimed to empower 
        the youth through the arts, education, and civic engagement. Social Works has 5 initiatives: 
        Support CPS, OpenMike, My State of Mind, Warmest Winter, and Kids of the Kingdom. One of my 
        favorite initiatives is the OpenMike, where high school students can showcase their talents 
        through a 3-minute piece of their choice. This opportunity gives students a chance to gain 
        exposure and perform in front of like-minded peers. </p>
